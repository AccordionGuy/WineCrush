It's a pretty straightforward game: you play by creating matching groups of wine-related images — glasses of wine, bottles, corks, grapes and cheese — in groups of three or more. You can create horizontal matching groups…\r\n\r\n![Animation of a horizontal match in \"Wine Crush\"](http://www.globalnerdy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/horizontal_match_example.gif)\r\n\r\n…or vertical matching groups:\r\n\r\n![Animation of a vertical match in \"Wine Crush\"](http://www.globalnerdy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/vertical-match-example.gif)\r\n\r\nYou score points for creating matching groups, and the goal for each level of the game is to score a target number of points within a given number of moves. If you meet the goal, you get to proceed to the next level. If you don’t, it’s GAME OVER.\r\n\r\n![\"Wine-O Bingo\" night at Aspirations Winery, Clearwater, Florida](http://www.globalnerdy.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/anitra-and-joey-at-aspirations-winery.jpg)\r\n_(Pictured above: “Wine-O Bingo” at Aspirations Winery, summer 2014. My wife Anitra’s third from the left, and I’m the smiling guy across the table from her, fourth from the right.)_\r\n\r\nWine Crush is designed as a promotional tool for Aspirations Winery, which is run by Bill and Robin Linville. My wife Anitra has been buying their wines for years. She took me to one of their regular “Wine-O Bingo” events in 2014 (pictured above), and made friends with them after entertaining their guests with a couple of their accordion numbers. Soon after, I approached them with a proposition: Would you like to have an iPhone game for your winery?\r\n\r\nThey said yes, and I got to work. Starting with the “How to make a game link Candy Crush” tutorials from RayWenderlich.com as a basis, I put together a game with wine-related imagery and Aspirations’ branding, using artwork that Robin provided. The backgrounds for the games’ levels are various labels for Aspirations’ wines, and there are a couple of buttons on the main screen that you can click to find out more about the winery.\r\n\r\nFor Aspirations, it’s a cute little way to get their name out their in a way that sets them apart from most other small family-owned wineries. As for me, this app is a way for me to help out some friends, sharpen my programming skills, build a portfolio, and gain some valuable experience with the App Store. Aside from a fair bit of free wine (for which I’m very grateful), I’m not getting paid for this project.\r\n",
